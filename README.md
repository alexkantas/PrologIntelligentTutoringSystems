## Run
Download and install [SWI prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable)

- Run the `Prolog.pl` file witch is the entry point of the web application

- Query `server(80).` on SWI Prolog Terminal

## Info

Front end is build with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)

The application uses the template engine [Simple-template by Raivo Laanemets](https://github.com/rla/simple-template)

The predicates have strange names (and different from handlers ) to keep reference from an older version on application witch used that names.
